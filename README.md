## Overview

**Project Aletheia** is a signature, multi-disciplinary initiative by Michael R. Murphy, focused on the design, documentation, and blueprinting of humanity’s first interstellar, self-sustaining civilization platform. Aletheia integrates advanced AI/AGI governance, brain-computer interfaces (BCI), decentralized infrastructure, and operational redundancy to serve as a living framework for resilient, transparent, and ethical interstellar society-building.

This repository is the authoritative public archive for all Project Aletheia technical documentation, design blueprints, release notes, and legacy materials.

> **All official project files and documents are published in the [Releases](https://github.com/ImpliedConsent/Project-Aletheia/releases) section.**

## Vision

- **Survivability:** Enable multi-generational survival beyond Earth through redundant systems and AGI-human synergy.
- **Transparency:** Radical documentation for future-proof accountability and operational clarity.
- **Ethics & Governance:** Foundational legal, ethical, and operational protocols for a post-Earth society.
- **Scientific Rigor:** All frameworks grounded in hard science, engineering best practices, and continuous audit.
- **Legacy:** A durable, auditable record for present and future generations.

---

## Features

- **Comprehensive documentation:** Living blueprints, engineering standards, and legacy design records.
- **AGI Governance:** Structured alignment, sandboxing, and ethical risk mitigation.
- **BCI/Neurotech:** Integration and governance of cognitive augmentation platforms.
- **Resilience Architecture:** Multi-layered redundancy and disaster recovery.
- **Legal & Policy Frameworks:** Constitutional templates, cultural quarantine protocols, and operational bylaws.

## How to Use

1. **Access the [Releases](https://github.com/ImpliedConsent/Project-Aletheia/releases):**  
   Download the latest blueprints, technical documentation, and living documents.

2. **Stay updated:**  
   Star or watch this repository for notifications on major updates.

3. **License:**  
   Project Aletheia is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE) for maximum openness and collaboration.

## Principles

- **Murphy Method:** Every decision and rule is documented, auditable, and built for maximum survivability with minimum waste.
- **No Ideological Bloat:** Hard science and operational pragmatism only—no non-essential ideological references.
- **Layered Redundancy:** All systems and personnel are cross-functional and equipped for disaster recovery.
- **Cultural Quarantine:** Earth-originating cultural and legal updates are sandboxed and reviewed before integration.
